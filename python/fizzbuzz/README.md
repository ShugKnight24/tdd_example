# FizzBuzz

Solving FizzBuzz in Python using a BDD & TDD approach.

## Requirements

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

Sample output:

1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
17
Fizz
19
Buzz
... etc up to 100

## Updated Requirements
Print 'Fuzz' if there is a 3 in the number
Print 'Buzz' if there is a 5 in the number

## Approach
Break the problem down into smaller problems...
Use 'Given', 'When', 'Then' to describe the problem and what the expected output is.
Red -> Green -> Refactor
Refactor the next smallest step

Jumped between lowest to highest numbers to see the different outcomes and how it was progressing

## Testing
Write tests from the bottom up to ensure that the program is working correctly and covers all the requirements.
Also helps to catch any bugs early and will idealy prevent them from being introduced.
